# HOW I MADE THIS PROJECT

**Task 1**

1. *Task 1 was basically about writing shell files(.sh) and using them...*
2. *I saved the file **hello.sh** in ~~file~~ folder coding101/Task1*
3. * **hello.sh** was created using vi using **vi hello.sh** command....I used **ls -l** to observe that the user had only the permission to read and write the code but not **execute** it...so I used **chmod 754 hello.sh** to give execution rights to the user and thus used **_./hello.sh_** to execute the shell*

**_Task 2_**

1. *We copied the text from [https://github.com/php/playground/blob/master/HelloWorld.txt](https://github.com/php/playground/blob/master/HelloWorld.txt )*
2. *I used grep to search  for instances of '**_World_**' in which I used command **grep -i 'World' hello.txt***
3. *I transferred the terminal output to **_output.txt_** using the command "** grep  'World' hello.txt > output.txt **" *

**Task 3**

1. *I created a public repo on my github accoutn named **coding-101** *
2. * I uploaded the coding101 file containing the previous two tasks using 
        - **git init**
        - **git add coding101**
        - **git commit -m "tasks"**
        - **git remote add coding https://github.com/sankr170104072/coding-101**
        - **git push -u coding master**
        - **git add README.md**
        - **git commit -m "tasks3"**
        - **git push***
3. *Finally I am adding this README file*

# HOW I MADE THIS PROJECT

**Task 1**
1. *Task 1 was basically about writing shell files(.sh) and using them...*
2. *I saved the file **hello.sh** in ~~file~~ folder coding101/Task1*

**_Task 2_**
1. *We copied the text from [https://github.com/php/playground/blob/master/HelloWorld.txt](https://github.com/php/playground/blob/master/HelloWorld.txt )*
2. *we used grep to search  for instances of '**_World_**' in which we used command **grep -i 'World' hello.txt***
